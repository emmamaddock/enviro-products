* A name
* A rating 1-5 on how much impact it has on the envrionment, with 1 being low and 5 being high

The user is able to do two things with this application:
1. Search for a product in the list
2. Sort the products by ascending or descending order

1. Download the repo
2. Open in VS Code
3. Download all necessary packages in the terminal with `npm install`
4. Enter the command `npm start`

Your browser should open a test server for the application.
